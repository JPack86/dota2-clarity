2. Quick Installation
---------------------

If you don't already have an autoexec.cfg, installation is easy. Simply copy
the contents of the dota folder to <Steam>/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota.
This will install the aliases and tutorials (but not the bindings or cvars, as
those should be specific to your setup).

If you do have an autoexec.cfg, copy the cfg/clarity/ folder to
<Steam>/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg and the scripts/tutorial folder to
<Steam>/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/scripts. Then add the following to
your autoexec.cfg:

con_enable 1
exec clarity/use_tutorials_and_aliases.cfg

---
3. Detailed Installation
------------------------

The file structure is designed so that you can include only the parts of
dota2-clarity that you want to use and ignore the rest. This works by keeping
all files in .../dota/cfg/clarity and exec'ing them from your autoexec.cfg.

1. Copy the dota/cfg/clarity folder itself to
   Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg.
2. Copy all custom_*.txt files from dota/scripts/tutorial to
   Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/scripts/tutorial.
3. Enable the Dota 2 console:

To enable only training missions and drills (recommended):

1. In your Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg/autoexec.cfg file,
   add `exec clarity/tutorials.cfg`.
2. Restart Dota 2, open the console, and enter one of the commands to start
   a training mission:
   * `train_radiant_juke_paths`
   * `train_dire_juke_paths`
   * `train_pull_wards`
   * `train_rune_wards`
   * `train_vision_wards`

To enable only some features (recommended):

1. Open clarity/example_use_all.cfg and clarity/binds.cfg.
2. Copy and modify the lines for the features you want to use into your
   autoexec.cfg.

To enable all features (not recommended):

1. In your Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta//dota/cfg/autoexec.cfg file,
   add `exec clarity/example_use_all.cfg`.

---
4. Usage
--------

Explore the clarity/ directory and read the documentation in the files that
interest you. Of particular interest is clarity/binds.cfg, which defines
key bindings for aliases defined by Clarity.

To use practice drills:

1. Start a local game with cheats enabled.
2. Open the console and enter the command to start the drill you want to run,
   e.g. `drill_juke_paths`.
3. Press the apostrophe key to print cheat keys to the console.

To use training missions:

1. At the main interface without a game started, open the console and enter the
   command to start the tutorial, e.g. `drill_rune_wards`.
2. Press the apostrophe key to print cheat keys to the console.
