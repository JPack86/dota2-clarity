// This example autoexec uses only the drills and the custom training missions
// from dota2-scripts. The easiest way to use this file is to add the line
// "exec autoexec_tutorials.cfg" to your autoexec.cfg.

// Practice drills

// Drills setup aliases and key binds for practicing a specific skill in a local
// game. To use a drill, enter a local game and then run its alias from the
// console.

// Training missions

// To use a training mission, run its alias from the console (you don't have to
// be in a local game to start these). Dota 2 will start a local game for you.
