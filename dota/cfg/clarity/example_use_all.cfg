// This example cfg file uses all of clarity. The easiest way to use it
// is to add the line `exec clarity/example_use_all.cfg` to your autoexec.cfg,
// however THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED as it tends to fudge your console settings.

// Instead, inspect this file and clarity/binds.cfg for the features you want
// and copy/modify those lines into your autoexec.cfg.
