// This example cfg file uses all of clarity. The easiest way to use it
// is to add the line `exec clarity/use_all.cfg` to your autoexec.cfg,
// however THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED as it tends to fudge your console settings.

// Instead, inspect this file and clarity/binds.cfg for the features you want
// and copy/modify those lines into your autoexec.cfg. OR you can just use
// use_tutorials_and_aliases.cfg by adding
//
//  exec use_tutorials_and_aliases.cfg
//
// to your autoexec.cfg.

// Console variables

exec clarity/cvars/console.cfg
exec clarity/cvars/gameplay.cfg
exec clarity/cvars/health_bars.cfg
exec clarity/cvars/minimap.cfg
exec clarity/cvars/net_graph.cfg

// Enable practice drills and training missions

exec clarity/use_tutorials_and_aliases.cfg

// Binds

exec clarity/example_binds.cfg
