Installing just the training missions:

1. Enable the Dota 2 console:
   http://wyksblog.com/guide-activating-the-console-in-dota-2

2. Copy and paste the dota2-scripts/dota directory to
   Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta. The files are named such that they will
   not overwrite any game files, your autoexec.cfg, or your config.cfg.

3. Add "exec autoexec_tutorials.cfg" to your autoexec.cfg

4. Restart Dota 2 and try to run a tutorial from the console, e.g.
   enter "tutorial_rune_wards" into the console. Available tutorials are listed
   in autoexec_tutorials.cfg.

   http://wyksblog.com/guide-activating-the-console-in-dota-2

2. Copy and paste the dota2-scripts/dota directory to
